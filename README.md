# Assignment 1: Linear Regression Analysis
In this assignment, I will use the Concrete Slump Test dataset to predict the strength of concrete by fitting linear regression models, using the [OLS method](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html) within the statsmodel package and the [SGDRegressor method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html) within the sci-kit-learn library.

The dataset was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repistory. Initially, the dataset contained 78 observations and 25 new observations were later added. Now, the dataset contains 103 observations and 10 variables.
